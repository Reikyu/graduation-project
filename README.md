Our graduation project theme is Wild Animal Catcher using Depth Camera.
Wild animals which lose their habitat and don't find feed show up at city and farm. So, produce and live stock are damaged and people receive a wound from wild animal's attack. Thus, there is a need to reduce wildlife that disturb the echosystem. To resolve this circumstance, robot that captures wildlife by using object detection tracking was devised. In the basic of python language, opencv and pyrealsense library was used. As Hardware, raspberrypi, aduino and intel depth camera was used.
